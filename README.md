# csv-async
This will be CSV library to use in asynchronous environment.
Implemented API is similar to existing [csv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv) crate except that this crate does not support `serde`.

Some code is borrowed from `csv` crate (synchronized with version 1.1.3 - May 2020).

Currently there is initial **Read** part implementation.  
**Write** part is in plans for the not far future.
