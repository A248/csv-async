# csv-async
This will be CSV library to use in asynchronous environment.
Implemented API is similar to existing [csv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv) crate,

Some code is borrowed from this crate and from rejected [PR](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv/pull/199).

Currently there is only preliminary Read part implementation.
